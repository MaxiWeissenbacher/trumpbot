# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with JavaScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## Before CDK Deploy

Third party dependencies must be installed in vendor folders and zipped with the handler function to be deployed to S3.

- pip install -t ./src/lambda/vendor/ -r requirements.txt
